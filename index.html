      <h1>Dou Ju</h1>
      <p>The "Dou Ju" project is a web-based game that combines traditional Chinese poetic form of "couplets" with the concept of "flyting" to create a competitive, voice-controlled challenge.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>"Flyting" is an ancient form of verbal combat, which involves hurling insults and witty retorts at one's opponent. It has a rich history in literature and was popular in many cultures, including medieval Europe, ancient Greece, and China. In modern times, this tradition has inspired the creation of games that utilize the same principles of verbal sparring.</p>
        <p>"Dou Ju" is one such game, which takes its name from the Chinese term for "verses that compete with each other." It is a modern take on the ancient flyting tradition, which incorporates elements of game design and technology to make it more engaging and accessible for modern audiences.</p>

        <h2>The Concept</h2>
        <p>The core concept of "Dou Ju" is simple. Two players take turns speaking phrases, each building on what the other has said to create a rhyming couplet. The catch is that each phrase must also contain an insult directed at the opponent.</p>
        <p>The game is won by the player who can come up with the most creative and humorous insults while also keeping the rhythm and rhyme of the couplets. It is a game of skill, creativity, and wit, which requires players to think on their feet and respond quickly to their opponent's insults.</p>

        <h2>Artistic Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The "Dou Ju" game was inspired by the rich history of "flyting" in literature and the arts. The ancient practice of verbal sparring has been depicted in many works of literature, including the famous "The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie," which was written in Middle Scots in the 16th century.</p>
        <p>The game also draws inspiration from Chinese literature, particularly the art of "duilian," which translates to "matching couplets." This is a form of Chinese poetry in which two lines of verse must match in length, tone, and rhyme, often used for celebrating festivals or important events.</p>
        <p>In "Dou Ju," players are not only competing with each other but also with the rich history and tradition of these ancient art forms. It is a way of keeping these traditions alive while also putting a modern spin on them.</p>

        <h2>Cultural and Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>The game has cultural and historical significance, as it draws on the rich history of "flyting" and Chinese poetry. It is an excellent way to introduce people to these art forms and to keep them alive in a modern context.</p>
        <p>Additionally, "Dou Ju" provides a unique way of exploring cultural differences and similarities. The game combines Western and Eastern traditions, creating a dialogue between  them through the medium of the game.</p>

        <h2>Technical Information</h2>
        <p>"Dou Ju" is a web-based game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game uses the Web Speech API to recognize speech input from the player and display it on the screen.        </p>
        <p>The game's interface is simple and intuitive, with a text box for players to enter their insults and a button to trigger the speech recognition. The game uses the Google Chrome browser, which supports the Web Speech API.</p>

        <p>The game is divided into 2 parts, one with the Viking "flyting" and the other with the Chinese "couplet". On the Viking side it is very easy to switch between the voices, follow the instructions in the learning document and it works. However, once I switched to Chinese, I was left scratching my head with all sorts of weird bugs.
            It took me dozens of iterations of troubleshooting before I finally found all the problems that were affecting the operation existed.
            </p>
            <p>The recognition rate for Chinese speech was very low, sometimes none of the 10 words in a sentence were correct and they were all recognized as other words with similar pronunciations. I asked chatgpt how to improve the accuracy of the speech input, and it told me to train the model myself. I think that's probably not something I can do for now.</p>

              <p>In addition to this, I used Midjourney, an ai, to help me with the illustrations.  </p>

            <h2>Reflection and Future Development</h2>
            <p>Reflect on how the project went, what went well, what you learnt etc. Based on these reflections, conclude with how you would further develop this project if you were to make another version or how you would further develop your ideas.</p>
            <p>The final result is still not good and if I have the opportunity to continue with this project afterwards, I will try to find ways to improve the quality of the speech recognition, perhaps using other better api interfaces. </p>
